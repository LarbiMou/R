# R Data Analysis Portfolio
Author: Larbi Moukhlis

### Project Overview
This repository contains R analyses covering:

Descriptive statistics (distributions, sector comparisons)

Predictive modeling (linear regression, k-means clustering)

Optimization (LP for resource allocation)

Data visualization (ggplot2, base R plots)

Key datasets: S&P 500 companies, global health indicators, Starbucks nutrition, fetal health diagnostics.

### File Descriptions
Core Analyses
Basketball_Player_Data_Profiling.Rmd: NBA player data type validation and summary stats.

Retail_Transaction_Data_Wrangling.Rmd: Sales data cleaning and transformation.

Statistical Modeling
Global_Health_Determinants_Regression.Rmd: Life expectancy predictors using OLS.

S&P500_Financial_Performance_Analysis.Rmd: Sectoral market cap trends and EBITDA clustering.

Fetal_Health_Prediction_Model.Rmd: Decision tree classification for fetal diagnostics.

Optimization
Manufacturing_Production_Optimization.Rmd: LP model for fitness equipment production.

Dietary_Cost_Minimization_Model.Rmd: Nutrient cost optimization.

### Technical Stack
Languages: R

Libraries:

Data Wrangling: dplyr, tidyr

Modeling: stats, caret, rpart

Visualization: ggplot2, lattice

Optimization: lpSolve

### How to Use

### Key Insights
S&P 500: Technology sector dominates market cap (avg. $1.2T).

Health Data: Income composition explains 62% of life expectancy variance.

Optimization: Steel availability drives 80% of profit sensitivity in production models.
