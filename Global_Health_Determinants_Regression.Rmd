# Data, Plots, Correlation Coefficient
Data taken from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who/data
-   link above is for your information on the data. 


## Before you load the data in the next chunk, use the link above to read about the data set. Give me one sentence on the data (many options, just give me your elevator pitch on what the data is using a comment # in the chunk)
```{r}
#comment your response here (just one fact about the dataset): 

# The data is related to life expectancy, it shows some of the health factors for more than a 190 countries, and it shows the most 'critical' factors when. it comes to mortality.

```


## Read the data from LifeExpectancyData.csv creating a new data frame called life 
```{r}
life = read.csv("LifeExpectancyData.csv")
rm(contract_counts)
```

## Display the top 10 rows of the data in life data frame

```{r}
colnames(life)
```
